### Basic Theory

The idea of generation is a generalization of [[Cyclic Groups]]. To form a cycli subgroup, we have chosen one element of the group, and look at the "**smallest subgroup**" that contains this chosen element. By closure under group operation and taking inverses, we can easily verify that this "minimal subgroup" contains exactly the powers of the generator. In this note, we shall extend this idea to cases with **more than one generators**. 

>[!d] Subgroup Generated by a Subset
>Let $G$ be a group and $A \subseteq G$. The *subgroup generated by $A$*, denoted as $\langle A \rangle$ is defined as: 
>$$
>\langle A \rangle = \bigcap_{\substack{A \subseteq H \\ H \leq G}} H
>$$

>[!warning] Ramark
>This definition simply means that the subgroup generated by a subset is the intersection of all subgroups containing the subset. This depicts the previously mentioned idea of a generated subgroup being the **smallest subgroup** that contains the generating set. 

We can verify that this definition does indeed produce a subgroup using the following proposition: 

>[!success] Intersection of Subgroups as a Subgroup
>If $\mathcal{A}$ is any non-empty collection of subgroups in a group $G$, then: 
>$$
>\bigcap_{H \in \mathcal{A}} H  \leq G
>$$

**Proof**: We shall use the [[Subgroups#Properties of Subgroups|Subgroup Criteria]]. Let
$$
K = \bigcap_{H \in \mathcal{A}} H
$$
and let $x, y \in k$ .Then, by definition of intersection, for any $H \in \mathcal{A}$, $x, y \in H$. As each $H$ is a subgroup, it is closed under taking inversed and group operation, so $xy^{-1} \in H$$ for all $H \in \mathcal{A}$, which prove that $xy^{-1} \in K$. By the Subgroup Criteria, we are done. 

Now, the problem with this definition of a generated subgroup is that it is not computationally conveniant -- to compute the subgroup, we first need to find all subgroups that contains the generating set, which is impractical in many groups. To resolve this issue, we need to consider the genetated subgroup as the *closure* of the generators under group operation: 

>[!d] Closure of a subset
>Let $G$ be a group and $A \subseteq G$, then the *closure* of $A$ in $G$, denoted as $\bar{A}$ is defined as: 
>$$
>\bar{A} = \{ a_1^{e_1}a_2^{e_2}...a_n^{e_n} : n \in \mathbb{N}, a_i \in A, e_i = \pm 1 \}
>$$

>[!warning] Remark
>Essentially, the closure of a subset consists of all **finite products** of the elements in the subset. 

Unsurprisingly, we have that the **closure of a subset is equal to the subgroup generated by the subset**: 

>[!success] Closure is equivalent to Generated Subgroup
>For a group $G$ and $A \subseteq G$, $\bar{A} = \langle A \rangle$. 

**Proof**: We shall first prove that $\bar{A}$ is a subgroup containing $A$. It is trivial that $\bar{A}$ is a subgroup since for any $x = a_1^{e_1}...a_n^{e_n}$ and $y = b_1^{\delta_1}...b_m^{\delta_m}$ in $\bar{A}$, we have:
$$
xy^{-1}=a_1^{e_1}...a_n^{e_n}b_m^{-\delta_m}...b_1^{-\delta_1} \in \bar{A}
$$
because it is also a finite product of elements of $A$. By the subgroup criteria, $\bar{A} \leq G$. It immediate from the definition of $\bar{A}$ that $A \subseteq \bar{A}$ so $\bar{A}$ is a subgroup of $G$ that contains $A$. Consequently, $\langle A \rangle \subseteq \bar{A}$. To prove the opposite inclusion, observe that since $A \subseteq \langle A \rangle$, and $\langle A \rangle$ is a subgroup, the subgroup generated by $A$ must contain all finite products of elements in $A$ by closure under group operationa and taking inverses, so $\bar{A} \subseteq \langle A \rangle$. As a result, we must have:
$$
\bar{A} = \langle A \rangle
$$

With the establishment of this result, we have rigorously argued that the closure of a subset $A$ is exactly the smallest subgroup that contains the subset $A$, i.e. is the group generated by $A$.

### Generated Subgroups in Abelian and Non-Abelian Groups

Knowing that we can "break down" a subgroup into its generators, it is natural for us to ask the question: Can we deduce the properties and structure of the subgroup entirely from its generators? It turns out that this is a much easier task for an **abelian group** than non-abelian groups. 

First, notice that if $G$ is abelian, then the subgroup generated by a **finite subset** $A = \{a_1, ..., a_k\}$ can be written as: 
$$
\langle A \rangle = \{ a_1^{e_1}...a_k^{e_k} : e_i \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$
as we can collect powers of the same element together in any finite product. If we assume further that $G$ is finite, we can find an upper bound for the order of $\langle A \rangle$, as shown in the following proposition: 

>[!success] Upper bound for $\langle A \rangle$ in Abelian Groups
>Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $A = \{ a_1, ..., a_k\}$ be a subset of $G$ such that $o(a_1) = d_1, ..., o(a_k) = d_k$, then:
>$$
>|\langle A \rangle | \leq \prod_{i = 1}^{k} d_i
>$$

**Proof**: Trivial. By the Multiplication Rule in Combinatorics, there are at most $d_1d_2...d_k$ distinct elements of the form $a_1^{e_1}...a_k^{e_k}$, which constitutes all elements $\langle A \rangle$ as discussed previsouly. 

This is satisfying, but in non-abelian groups, things are not so good-looking, as shown in the following three examples: 

>[!example] Generators of $D_{2n}$
>Other than the conventional generators of $r$ and $s$, the [[The Dihedral Group|Dihedral Group]] can also be generated by $s$ and $sr$ since we have that $r = s(sr)$, so these two elements do generate all of $D_{2n}$. However, notice that $o(s) = o(sr) = 2$, but the order of $D_{2n}$ is $2n$, which is not below $2 \times 2$. This shows that knowing the orders of the generators of a non-abelian group is not sufficient to deduce the order of the group. 

The same issue happens in the [[The Symmetric Group|Symmetric Group]] $S_{n}$: 

>[!example] Generators of $S_n$
>As we shall prove in other notes, $S_n = \langle (1, 2), (1, 2, ..., n) \rangle$ with $o(1, 2) = 2$ and $o(1, 2, ..., n) = n$, but:
>$$
>|S_n| = n! > 2n
>$$
>for any $n > 3$. 

An even more dramatic example occurs in the [[The Matrix Group and Quaternions|Matrix Group]] $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$: 

>[!example] Generated Subgroup in $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$
>Consider the subgroup generated by $a, b \in GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ as shown below: 
>$$
>a = \begin{pmatrix}
>0 & 1 \\
>1 & 0
>\end{pmatrix}, \; \; b = \begin{pmatrix}
>0 & 2 \\
>\frac{1}{2} & 0
>\end{pmatrix}
>$$
>Notice that $a^2 = b^2 = 1$, showing that $o(a) = o(b) = 2$, however: 
>$$
>ab = \begin{pmatrix}
>\frac{1}{2} & 0\\ 
>0 & 2
>\end{pmatrix}
>$$
>which has infinite order. Hence, we see that two elements of finite order can in fact generate a subgroup of **infinite order**. 

It is in general much difficult to determine properties of a non-abelian subgroup from its generators, but we can resolve the issue somewhat by choosing the generators from the **center** of the group to impose the additional commutativity required. 

### Finitely Generated Groups and Maximal Subgroups

Finite groups are great, and the closest an infinite group can get to a finite group is when it is *finitely generated*: 

>[!d] Finitely Generated Groups
>A Group $G$ is *finitely generated* if there exists a finite set $A$ such that $G = \langle A \rangle$. 

In other words, a group is finitely generated if and only if it can be generated by a finite set of generators. The following are some example of finitely generated groups:

>[!example] Examples of Finitely Generated Groups
>1. All cyclic groups are finitely generated. 
>2. As seen from previous examples, $D_{2n} = \langle r, s \rangle$ and $S_n = \langle (1, 2), (1, 2, ..., n) \rangle$ are both finitely generated. 
>3. $\mathbb{Z}$ is finitely generated as $\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1  \rangle$. This shows that finitely generated groups are not necessarily finite. 

As an interesting result, we shall prove that all finitely generated groups contain a "maximum" subgroup. We make rigorous this concept in the following definition:

>[!d] Maximal Subgroup
>A subgroup $M$ of $G$ is a *maximal subgroup* if and only if the only $M \neq G$ and the only subgroups containing $M$ are $G$ and $M$. 

We have the following example for maximal groups:

>[!example] Example of Maximal Subgroups
>We claim that the subgroup generated by $r$ in $D_{2n}$ is a maximal subgroup of $D_{2n}$. Suppose not, then there exists a subgroup $H$ containing all powers of $r$ and one of $sr^i$ for some $i \in \mathbb{N}$, then we have: 
>$$
>(sr^i)r^{-i} = s \in H
>$$
>Because $s$ and $r$ are generators of $D_{2n}$, $H = D_{2n}$ which is a contradiction.

The following proposition proves that every finitely generated (not necessarily finite) group has a maximal subgroup using *Zorn's Lemma*. 

>[!success] Finitely Generated Groups and Maximal Subgroup
>Every finitely generated group has a maximal subgroup. 

**Proof**: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all proper subgroups of a group $G$ and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a chain of subgroups in $\mathcal{S}$ Suppose $\mathcal{C} =\{G_1, G_2, ...,G_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$, then the subgroups in $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $G_1 \leq G_2 \leq ... \leq G_n$). We shall prove that:
$$
H = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} G_i \in \mathcal{S}
$$
which is equivalent to proving that $H = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} G_i$ is a proper subgroup of $G$. We first prove that $H \leq G$. This is trivial since for any $x, y \in H$, there exists $G_i, G_j$ such that $x \in G_i, y \in G_j$. WLOG suppose that $i > j$, then as $G_j \leq G_i$, $y \in G_i$, so naturally $xy^{-1} \in G_i \in H$. By the subgroup criteria, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. To prove that $H$ is a proper subgroup, consider the generators of $G$. As $G$ is finitely generated, let its generators be $\{g_1, g_2, ..., g_k\}$. Suppose FTSOC that $H = G$, then every generator is in $H$, consequently, there exist a sequence $i_1, i_2, ..., i_k$ such that:
$$
g_1 \in G_{i_1}, g_2 \in G_{i_2}, ... ,g_k \in G_{i_k}
$$
Let $m = \max\{i_1, i_2, ..., i_k\}$, then all generators $g_i$ are in $G_m$ and consequently, $G_m = G$. However, as $G_m \in \mathcal{S}$, $G_m$ must be a proper subgroup, which leads to a contradiction. Thus, $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, which shows that $H \in \mathcal{S}$. Hence, we have shown that every chain in $\mathcal{S}$ has an upper bound (under the partial order of set inclusion), which by *Zorn's Lemma* implies that there is a maximum element in $\mathcal{S}$, i.e. a maximal subgroup of $G$. 

### Classification of Groups of Order 4

Apart from the Cyclic group of order $4$, there exists another group of order $4$, as we shall define below: 

>[!d] Klein $4$-Group
>The *Klein 4- Group*, denoted by $V_4$, consists of $4$ elements $\{e, a, b, c\}$ with multiplication defined as in the following multiplication table: 
>
>![[Pasted image 20241003231409.png | center | 200]]
>i.e. any the square of any element is the identity, and the product of any two distinct non-identity elements gives the third non-identity element. 

>[!warning] Note
>The Klein 4-Group is an Abelian Group of order $4$. 

Are there any other groups of order $4$ that are not isomorphic to either the Klein 4-Group or the cyclic group of order $4$? The following **classification theorem** says no: 

>[!success] Classification of Groups of Order $4$
>For a group $G$, if $|G| = 4$,  then $G \simeq Z_4$ or $G \simeq V_4$. 

**Proof**:
