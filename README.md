These are the Group Theory Notes for Philomath. 

## Reference Textbooks
* _Abstract Algebra_, Dummit and Foote
* _Algebra_, Hungerford
* _Algebra_, Artin
* _Groups and Symmetry_, Armstrong


(The notes primarily follows the structure of Dummit and Foote, with extra bits of extension, i.e. exercise problems or important techniques in Group Theory)

## How should I view these notes? 
(You can of course view them directly on Github, but some of the pretty features would not be rendered! So, it is recommended that you download **Obsidian** to ensure the best experience reading the notes. You can follow the steps below to link your obsidian vault with this repository to get real-time updates in the notes.) 

## Setup of Obsidian
1. Download Obsidian. Go to https://obsidian.md/ and click "Get Obsidian for Windows" (or "other platforms" if you are using Mac)
3. Open Obsidian. In the first pop out window, select "create a new vault", and name it witth whatever name you want.
4. In the new vault you created, navigate to the bottom left corner and click the icon of a gear (this is the settings page for your vault).
5. In the settings page, go to "community Plugins" and enable it. Then click "browse" and search for a plugin called "Git". This plugin allows you to connect the vault with this repository.
6. Install Git and remember to turn it on in the "Community Plugin" page.
7. Click Ctrl + P to open the Command Palette. Type in "Clone" and choose "Clone an existing remote repo". Press Enter. 
8. Copy the URL of this Github Repository: https://github.com/Bobidium/GroupTheory and **add .git** at the end. Press Enter. 
9. Choose empty for the directory of clone, or "Vault root" if you are using IOS. Press Enter.
10. Then, you will be asked whether your remote repo contain a .obsidian directory at root. Choose **"Yes"**. Press Enter
11. Finally, select "Detete all your local config and plugins". This will automatically link everything in this repository to your Obsidian Vault.

## How to Sync Obsidian with Github
There are two ways you can do this. Here is one: 
1. Go to the "Settings" page, "Community Plugin" and then click the gear icon beside "Git". This is the settings page for the Git plugin. 
2. In this page, find "pull on startup" and turn it on. This means that the Obsidian will automatically sync with Github every time you open Obsidian.
3. Make sure you turn off "auto commit-and-sync after stopping file edits" to prevent accidental changes to the notes.

When you want to sync (or **pull**) manually in Obsidian, you can set up a hotkey: 
1. In the "Community Plugin" page, go to the icon of a plus within a circle next to "Git".
2. Find the command "Git:Pull" and click the plus sign next to it.
3. Press the key combination you like and every time you want to pull the notes from Github, using the same key combination. (I am using "Alt+P")
