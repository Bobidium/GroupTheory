How should I view these notes? 
(You can of course view them directly on Github, but some of the pretty features would not be rendered! So, it is recommended that you download **Obsidian** to ensure the best experience reading the notes. You can follow the steps below to link your obsidian vault with this repository to get real-time updates in the notes.) 

1. Download Obsidian. Go to https://obsidian.md/ and click "Get Obsidian for Windows" (or "other platforms" if you are using Mac)
3. Open Obsidian. In the first pop out window, select "create a new vault", and name it witth whatever name you want.
4. In the new vault you created, navigate to the bottom left corner and click the icon of a gear (this is the settings page for your vault).
5. In the settings page, go to "community Plugins" and enable it. Then click "browse" and search for a plugin called "Git". This plugin allows you to connect the vault with this repository.
