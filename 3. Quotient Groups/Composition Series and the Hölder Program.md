### Finite Abelian Groups and Simple Groups

We first prove an important proposition about Finite Abelian Groups that is a weakened version of [[Theorem of Cauchy|Cauchy's Theorem]]. The proof of the proposition illustrates the power of induction in finite group theory: 

>[!success] Cauchy's Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups
>If $G$ is a finite abelian group and $p$ is a prime dividing $|G|$, then $G$ contains an element of order $p$. 

**Proof**: We proceed by induction on the order of $G$. In the base case, the proposition is obviously true for the trivial group $\{e\}$. Suppose that for all positive integers $k < n$, any group with order $k$ satisfies the proposition, we want to prove that any group of order $n$ satisfies the proposition. If $G$ is [[Cyclic Groups|cyclic]], then we are done, as the subgroups of a cyclic group corresponds bijectively to the factors of $|G|$. If $G$ is not cyclic, then there exists an element $x \in G$ such that $o(x) < |G|$. Then, as $G$ is an abelian group, $\langle x \rangle \unlhd G$. Since $|\langle x \rangle| < |G|$, we can use the inductive hypothesis to deduce that for every prime dividing $o(x)$, there is a corresponding subgroup of the desired order in $\langle x \rangle$. If $p \nmid o(x)$, then we can consider the quotient group $G / \langle x \rangle$. As $|G / \langle x \rangle| = G / o(x)$, $p$ must divide $|G / \langle x \rangle|$. By the inductive hypothesis, we can again deduce that there exists a subgroup of order $p$ in $G/\langle x \rangle$. Hence, there exists $g\langle x\rangle \in G / \langle x \rangle$ such that $o(g\langle x \rangle) = p$. This implies that $g^p \in \langle x \rangle$, and that $p \mid o(g)$ which again implies the existence of a cyclic group of order $p$ in $G$. This completes the proof. 

This is an elegant proof and illustrates some important ideas in finite group theory. 

>[!abstract] Key Ideas
>1. we can see the idea of **piecing together information about a normal subgroup and its quotient group to obtain information about our original group**. Since both the subgroup and the quotient group has order less than the original group. we can use the inductive hypothesis to obtain their information. We will see this idea again in the second part of the *Hölder Program*. 
>2. The reason why this argument works so well is based on the fact that $G$ is **finite and abelian**, so every subgroup of $G$ is normal and we can utilise the quotient group nicely in our proof. However, in most groups, we don't have such strong properties, which makes things more difficult when we want to prove statement about any aribtrary group. 

On the other end of the spectrum, opposing finite abelian groups, we have the *simple groups*: 

>[!d] Simple Groups
>A group $G$ is *simple* if $|G| > 1$ and the only normal subgroups of $G$ are $\{e\}$ and $G$. 

In other words, a simple group has no proper normal subgroups other than the trivial group, which is the exact contrary of finite abelian groups. For this reason, the number of differen "types" of finite abelian groups that are simple are in fact greatly limited. In the following proposition, we prove the even stronger assertion that there is only one kind of simple abelian groups, i.e. $Z_p$: 

>[!success] Characterization of Simple Abelian Groups
>Let $G$ be a group. If $G$ is simple and abelian, then $G \simeq Z_p$ for some prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$. 

**Proof**: We first show that any abelian simple group must be cyclic. To see this, notice that the subgroup generated by any non-identity element in $G$ must equal as otherwise, $G$ would contain a proper subgroup, which is a normal subgroup given that $G$ is abelian, resulting in a contradiction. Hence, $G$ must be generated by a single element and is hence cyclic. Now, if $G$ is infinite, then $G \simeq \mathbb{Z}$, and $G$ must contain proper non-trivial subgroups. Therefore, $G$ cannot be infinite. When $G$ is finite, the only possibility is that $|G| = p$, where $p$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}$ since otherwise, $G$'s subgroups correspond bijectively to the non-trivial factors of $|G|$, which again indicates that $G$ is not simple. As a result, we can conclude that: 
$$
G \simeq Z_p
$$
for some prime $p$. 

>[!warning] Note
>Notice that in the proof of the above proposition, we have also shown that there exists no infinite abelian groups that are finite, as they must be [[Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms|Isomorphic]] to $\mathbb{Z}$. 

### Jordan-Hölder Theorem and the Hölder Program

Due to the fact that Simple groups cannot be factored into Quotient Groups, they are **analogous to the primes** in $\mathbb{Z}$, and just like the Unique Factorization Theorem in $\mathbb{Z}$, we can "factor" any group uniquely into simple groups in the form of *composition series*: 

>[!d] Composition Series
>In a group $G$, a *chain* of subgroups:
>$$
>1 = N_0 \unlhd N_1 \unlhd N_2 \unlhd ... \unlhd N_{k-1} \unlhd N_k = G
>$$
>is called a *composition series* if and only $N_{i+1} / N_i$ is a simple group for all $0 \leq i \leq k-1$. In this case, the quotient groups $N_{i+1} / N_i$ are called *composition factors* of $G$. 

>[!warning] Note
>It is important to remember that normality of a subgroup is **not transitive**, in other words, $N_1 \unlhd N_2$ and $N_2 \unlhd N_3$ does not imply that $N_1 \unlhd N_3$. 

The "Unique factorization Theorem" of Groups is called the *Jordan-Hölder Theorem*, as stated below: 

>[!success] Jordan-Hölder Theorem
>Let $G$ be a finite group with $G \neq \{e\}$, then the composition factors in a composition series are unique, i.e., if $$1 = N_0 \unlhd N_1 \unlhd N_2 \unlhd ... \unlhd N_{r-1} \unlhd N_r = G$$ and $$1 = M_0 \unlhd M_1 \unlhd M_2 \unlhd ... \unlhd M_{s-1} \unlhd M_s = G$$ are two composition series, then $r = s$ and there exists a permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, 2, ..., r\}$ such that:
>$$
>M_{\pi(i)} / M_{\pi(i)-1} \simeq N_i / N_{i-1}
>$$
>for all $1 \leq i \leq r$. 

To prove this theorem, we need some lemmas first. The first lemma asserts that every group has at least one composition series: 

>[!success] Lemma 1: Existence of Composition Series
>Le $G$ be a finite group, then $G$ has a composition Series. 

**Proof**: We proceed with proof by induction on the order of $G$. In the base case, we have $|G| = 1$, which implies that $G = \{e\}$, and the proposition is trivially true. Suppose that for a fixed $n$, all groups with order less than $n$ has a composition series, we now show that all groups $G$ with order $n$ has a composition series. If $G$ is simple, then $G$ has the trivial composition series, i.e. $\{e\} \unlhd G$. If $G$ is not simple, then $G$ contains a proper, nontrivial normal subgroup $H$. If $G / H$ is simple, then we can use the inductive hypothesis on $H$ to conclude that: 
$$
1 \unlhd H_1 \unlhd H_2 \unlhd ... \unlhd H \unlhd G
$$
is a composition series of $G$, wherein $1 \unlhd H_1 \unlhd H_2 \unlhd ... \unlhd H$ is a composition series of $H$. If $G/H$ is not simple, then there exists a non-trivial $A/H \unlhd G/H$ where $H \leq A$. By the [[Isomorphism Theorems|Fourth Isomorphism Theorem]], we have that $A \unlhd G$. We can apply the above procedure again to produce a composition series for $G$, and this process eventually ends due to the finiteness of $G$. Therefore, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude that $G$ must have a composition series. 

The next lemma asserts that every normal subgroup must be part of a composition series: 

>[!success] Lemma 2: Normal Subgroups and Composition Series
>If $G$ is a finite group and $H \unlhd G$, then there is a composition series of $G$, one of whose terms is $H$.
