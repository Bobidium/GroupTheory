### Generators of $S_n$

In this section, we expand the properties of the symmetric group $S_n$ introduced in the note [[The Symmetric Group]]. Firstly, we shall be loonking for a [[Subgroups Generated by Subsets|Generating Set]] of $S_n$ to simplify our works later. We already know that any permutation in $S_n$ can be written as **distinct cycles**, and with the development of more tools, we will be able to prove that for each permutation, this decomposition is unique. Naturally, this tells us that $S_n$ can be generated by the set of all cycles in $S_n$, but can we find a simpler generating set than even this? Notice that for a cycle $(a_1a_2...a_n)$, it can be further decomposed into: 
$$
(a_1a_2...a_n) = (a_1a_2)(a_1a_3)...(a_1a_n)
$$
Visually, the product of *transpositions* on the RHS are doing the following sequence of operations: 
$$
(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) \to (a_n, a_2, ..., a_1) \to (a_n, a_2, ..., a_1, a_{n-1})
 \to ... \to (a_n, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}) $$
 which gives the same result as the simple permutation $(a_1a_2...a_n)$. Using this method, we can decompose any $n$-cycle into a product of transpotitions: 
 
>[!d] Transpositions
>A *Transposition* in $S_n$ is a $2$-cycle. 

We have hence proved the following proposition:

>[!success] Transpositions generate $S_n$
>Let $S$ denote the set of all transpositions in $S_n$, i.e.
>$$
>S = \{(ij) : 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n\}
>$$
>Then, $S_n = \langle S \rangle$. 

>[!warning] Note
>As an interesting deviation, this proposition allows us to prove the *generalized commutativity* from the basic commutativity of $2$ elements, because essentially the proposition is saying that we can permute $n$ elements in all possible ways by repeatedly swapping two elements each time. 

The set of all transpositions is not the only generating subset of $S_n$, in fact, we have an even simpler generating subset of $S_n$ as shown below: 

>[!success] Two Elements that Generate $S_n$
>$S_n = \langle (12), (12...n)\rangle$ for all $n \geq 2$. 

**Proof**: First, we show that:
$$
S_n = \langle (i, i+1) | 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \rangle
$$
This can be proved simply by noticing that any transposition $(ij)$ (Assume WLOG that $j > i$) can be written as: 
$$
(ij) = (i, i+1) (i+1, i+2)...(j-1, j-2)(j-1, j) (j-1, j-2), ..., (i+1, i+2)(i, i+1)
$$
To justify this, notice that the transpositions up to and including $(j-1, j)$ have moved element $j$ to the position of $i$, and the rest of the transpositions moved element $i$ to the position of $j$. All other elements are unchanged throughout. Hence, with the previous proposition, we can see that $S_n$ can be generated by **transpositions of adjacent elements**. This statement itself is a stengthened version of the previous proposition. 

Using the fact proven above, we can show that $S_n = \langle (12), (12...n) \rangle$. It suffices to prove that every transposition of adjacent elements can be expressed as a sequence of product of the two elements. Again, we can simply notice that the transposition $(i, i+1)$ can be written as:
$$
(i, i+1) = (12...n)^{i-1}(12)(12...n)^{-i+1}
$$
This can be verified by looking at where $i$ and $i+1$ are mapped to. When $(12...n)^{-i+1}$ is applied, $i$ gets mapped to $1$ and $i+1$ gets mapped to position $2$. After the transposition $(12)$, $i$ will be mapped to$2$ and $i+1$ will be mapped to $1$. Then, the final cycle maps $1$ to $i$ and likewise, $2$ is mapped to $i+1$. Hence, this is equivent to the transposition of $i$ and $i+1$ and completes the proof of the proposition.  

### Sign of Permutations

The fact that each permutation can be expressed as a product of transpositions motivates the following question: It is obvious that each permutation can be decomposed into transpositions in a variety of ways. Are there any **commonalities** between these decompositions? This leads naturally to the notion of the *sign* of permutations and we shall prove in this subsection that for any permutation, the **parity** of the number of transpositions is the same in all decompositions into transpositions. 

We shall define the *sign* of a permutation without using parities and then prove that this definition is equivalent to the parity definition. In this case, we shall define the sign using **polynomials**: 

>[!d] Sign of a Permutation
>Let $x_1, ..., x_n$ be independent variables, and let $\Delta$ be the polynomial such that:
>$$
>\Delta = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_i - x_j)
>$$
>Let $\sigma \in S_n$ act on the polynomial $\Delta$ by exchanging the indices: 
>$$
>\sigma(\Delta) = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_{\sigma(i)} - x_{\sigma(j)})
>$$
>Then consequently, we have that:
>$$
>\sigma(\Delta) = \pm \Delta
>$$
>Using this fact, we can define the sign of the permutation $\epsilon(\sigma)$ as:
>$$
>\epsilon(\sigma) = \begin{cases}
>1 & \text{if } \sigma(\Delta) = \Delta \\
>-1 & \text{if } \sigma(\Delta) = -\Delta
>\end{cases}
>$$
>If $\epsilon(\sigma) = 1$, $\sigma$ is an *even permutation*, otherwise, $\sigma$ is an *odd permutation*. 

>[!warning] Note
>Notice that in each factor of the polynomial, the index of the variables is always **increasing**. In this sense, the sign of a permutation is the **parity** of the number of factors that has the indices reversed when acted by $\sigma$. 

We shall illustrate this definition using an example: 

>[!example] Example of Sign of Permutation
>Consider the permutation $(1234) \in S_4$, the corresponding polynomial $\Delta$ in $S_4$ is:
>$$
>\Delta = (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_3) (x_3 - x_4)(x_1 - x_3)(x_1 - x_4)(x_2 - x_4)
>$$
>When we consider the action of $(1234)$ on the polynomial, we have that: 
>$$
 \begin{align}
\sigma(\Delta) &= (x_2 - x_3)(x_3 - x_4)(x_4 - x_1)(x_2 - x_4)(x_2  -x_1)(x_3 - x_1)\\
&= (x_2 - x_3)(x_3 - x_4)(-(x_1 - x_4))(x_2 - x_4)(-(x_1  -x_2))(-(x_1 - x_3)) \\
&= -\Delta
\end{align}
>$$
Hence, $\epsilon(1234) = -1$ and $(1234)$ is an odd permutation in in $S_4$.
