### Generators of $S_n$

In this section, we expand the properties of the symmetric group $S_n$ introduced in the note [[The Symmetric Group]]. Firstly, we shall be loonking for a [[Subgroups Generated by Subsets|Generating Set]] of $S_n$ to simplify our works later. We already know that any permutation in $S_n$ can be written as **distinct cycles**, and with the development of more tools, we will be able to prove that for each permutation, this decomposition is unique. Naturally, this tells us that $S_n$ can be generated by the set of all cycles in $S_n$, but can we find a simpler generating set than even this? Notice that for a cycle $(a_1a_2...a_n)$, it can be further decomposed into: 
$$
(a_1a_2...a_n) = (a_1a_2)(a_1a_3)...(a_1a_n)
$$
Visually, the product of *transpositions* on the RHS are doing the following sequence of operations: 
$$
(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) \to (a_n, a_2, ..., a_1) \to (a_n, a_2, ..., a_1, a_{n-1})
 \to ... \to (a_n, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}) $$
 which gives the same result as the simple permutation $(a_1a_2...a_n)$. Using this method, we can decompose any $n$-cycle into a product of transpotitions: 
 
>[!d] Transpositions
>A *Transposition* in $S_n$ is a $2$-cycle. 

We have hence proved the following proposition:

>[!success] Transpositions generate $S_n$
>Let $S$ denote the set of all transpositions in $S_n$, i.e.
>$$
>S = \{(ij) : 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n\}
>$$
>Then, $S_n = \langle S \rangle$. 

>[!warning] Note
>As an interesting deviation, this proposition allows us to prove the *generalized commutativity* from the basic commutativity of $2$ elements, because essentially the proposition is saying that we can permute $n$ elements in all possible ways by repeatedly swapping two elements each time. 

The set of all transpositions is not the only generating subset of $S_n$, in fact, we have an even simpler generating subset of $S_n$ as shown below: 

>[!success] Two Elements that Generate $S_n$
>$S_n = \langle (12), (12...n)\rangle$ for all $n \geq 2$. 

**Proof**: First, we show that:
$$
S_n = \langle (i, i+1) | 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \rangle
$$
This can be proved simply by noticing that any transposition $(ij)$ (Assume WLOG that $j > i$) can be written as: 
$$
(ij) = (i, i+1) (i+1, i+2)...(j-1, j-2)(j-1, j) (j-1, j-2), ..., (i+1, i+2)(i, i+1)
$$
To justify this, notice that the transpositions up to and including $(j-1, j)$ have moved element $j$ to the position of $i$, and the rest of the transpositions moved element $i$ to the position of $j$. All other elements are unchanged throughout. Hence, with the previous proposition, we can see that $S_n$ can be generated by **transpositions of adjacent elements**. This statement itself is a stengthened version of the previous proposition. 

Using the fact proven above, we can show that $S_n = \langle (12), (12...n) \rangle$. It suffices to prove that every transposition of adjacent elements can be expressed as a sequence of product of the two elements. Again, we can simply notice that the transposition $(i, i+1)$ can be written as:
$$
(i, i+1) = (12...n)^{i-1}(12)(12...n)^{-i+1}
$$
This can be verified by looking at where $i$ and $i+1$ are mapped to. When $(12...n)^{-i+1}$ is applied, $i$ gets mapped to $1$ and $i+1$ gets mapped to position $2$. After the transposition $(12)$, $i$ will be mapped to$2$ and $i+1$ will be mapped to $1$. Then, the final cycle maps $1$ to $i$ and likewise, $2$ is mapped to $i+1$. Hence, this is equivent to the transposition of $i$ and $i+1$ and completes the proof of the proposition.  

### Sign of Permutations

The fact that each permutation can be expressed as a product of transpositions motivates the following question: It is obvious that each permutation can be decomposed into transpositions in a variety of ways. Are there any **commonalities** between these decompositions? This leads naturally to the notion of the *sign* of permutations and we shall prove in this subsection that for any permutation, the **parity** of the number of transpositions is the same in all decompositions into transpositions. 

We shall define the *sign* of a permutation without using parities and then prove that this definition is equivalent to the parity definition. In this case, we shall define the sign using **polynomials**: 

>[!d] Sign of a Permutation
>Let $x_1, ..., x_n$ be independent variables, and let $\Delta$ be the polynomial such that:
>$$
>\Delta = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_i - x_j)
>$$
>Let $\sigma \in S_n$ act on the polynomial $\Delta$ by exchanging the indices: 
>$$
>\sigma(\Delta) = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_{\sigma(i)} - x_{\sigma(j)})
>$$
>Then consequently, we have that:
>$$
>\sigma(\Delta) = \pm \Delta
>$$
>Using this fact, we can define the sign of the permutation $\epsilon(\sigma)$ as:
>$$
>\epsilon(\sigma) = \begin{cases}
>1 & \text{if } \sigma(\Delta) = \Delta \\
>-1 & \text{if } \sigma(\Delta) = -\Delta
>\end{cases}
>$$
>If $\epsilon(\sigma) = 1$, $\sigma$ is an *even permutation*, otherwise, $\sigma$ is an *odd permutation*. 

>[!warning] Note
>Notice that in each factor of the polynomial, the index of the variables is always **increasing**. In this sense, the sign of a permutation is the **parity** of the number of factors that has the indices reversed when acted by $\sigma$. 

We shall illustrate this definition using an example: 

>[!example] Example of Sign of Permutation
>Consider the permutation $(1234) \in S_4$, the corresponding polynomial $\Delta$ in $S_4$ is:
>$$
>\Delta = (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_3) (x_3 - x_4)(x_1 - x_3)(x_1 - x_4)(x_2 - x_4)
>$$
>When we consider the action of $(1234)$ on the polynomial, we have that: 
>$$
 \begin{align}
\sigma(\Delta) &= (x_2 - x_3)(x_3 - x_4)(x_4 - x_1)(x_2 - x_4)(x_2  -x_1)(x_3 - x_1)\\
&= (x_2 - x_3)(x_3 - x_4)(-(x_1 - x_4))(x_2 - x_4)(-(x_1  -x_2))(-(x_1 - x_3)) \\
&= -\Delta
\end{align}
>$$
Hence, $\epsilon(1234) = -1$ and $(1234)$ is an odd permutation in in $S_4$.  

Notice that the "sign" of a permutation is in fact a map from $S_n$ to $\pm 1$. Moreover, we can prove that it is a [[Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms|Homomorphism]], as shown in the following proposition: 

>[!success] Sign Function is a Homomorphism
>The sign function $\epsilon : S_n \to \{\pm 1\}$ defined above is a homomorphism. 

**Proof**: By the definition of sign, we have that for any $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, the product $\tau \sigma$ acts on the polynomial $\Delta$ giving the result: 
$$
\tau \sigma(\Delta) = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_{\tau \sigma(i)} - x_{\tau \sigma(j)})
$$
By the definition of the product of permutations, we can show that:
$$
\tau \sigma(\Delta) = \tau (\sigma(\Delta)) =  \tau(\prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_{ \sigma(i)} - x_{ \sigma(j)}))
$$
Suppose $\epsilon(\sigma) = (-1)^k$, then the above expression can be written as: 
$$
\tau \sigma(\Delta) = (-1)^k\tau(\Delta) = \epsilon(\sigma) \tau(\Delta)
$$
Notice that we can pull out the factor of $(-1)^k$ because $\tau$ only permutes the indices and the multiplication by a constant doesn't change the result. Hence, further expanding the expression yields: 
$$
\tau \sigma(\Delta) = \epsilon(\sigma) (\prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_{ \sigma(i)} - x_{ \sigma(j)})) = \epsilon(\sigma) \epsilon(\tau) \Delta
$$
Hence, we may conclude that: 
$$
\epsilon(\sigma \tau) = \epsilon(\sigma) \epsilon(\tau)
$$
which proves that the sign function is indeed a homomorphism. 

From this proposition, we may deduce that the ordinary rules of parity holds for the permutations, i.e.: 
$$
\begin{align}
\text{odd} \times \text{odd} &= \text{odd} \\
\text{even} \times  \text{even} &= \text{even}\\
\text{odd} \times \text{even} &= \text{even}
\end{align}
$$
where the "even" and "odd" refer to the signs of permutations. 

The fact that $\epsilon$ is a homomorphism is very useful in calculations. For instance, we can shows that every transposition is an odd permutation: 

>[!success] Transpositions are Odd Permutations
>For any $(ij) \in S_n$, $\epsilon(ij) = 1$. 

**Proof**: First, notice that $\epsilon(12) = -1$ as $(12)$ only reverses the indices in the factor $(x_1 - x_2)$ in $\Delta$ (As $x_1, x_2$ have the smallest indices). Next, we can see that any transposition $(ij)$ can be written as:
$$
(ij) = \lambda (12) \lambda
$$
where $\lambda$ is the transposition $(1i)$. As $\epsilon$ is a homomorphism, we have the followig calculation:
$$
\begin{align}
\epsilon(ij) &= \epsilon(\lambda(12)\lambda)\\
&= \epsilon(\lambda)^2 \epsilon(12)\\
&= 1 \times (-1) \\
&= -1
\end{align}
$$
Hence, all transpositions are odd permutations. 

As a consequence of this proposition, we have that if a permutation can be expressed as a product of $n$ transpositions, then the sign of the permutation is simply $(-1)^n$. In other words, if $n$ is even, then the permutation is even; if $n$ is odd, then the permutation is odd. Since the sign of a permutation is **uniquely defined** without ambiguity for each, we can finally deduce that no matter how we decompose a permutation into transposition,  the number of transpositions in each decomposition must have the **same parity** as they must give out the same sign of the permutation. 

>[!warning] Note
>Up to this point, we can see the benefits in defining the sign independent of the parity of the number of transpositions. In this as long as we can prove that these two definitions are equivalent, we can easily deduce that all transposition decompositions of the same permutation have the same parity in the number of transpositions. If we defined sign directly using parity, the proof would have been much more tedious. 

As a simple example, we can use the above discussions to compute the sign of an $n$-cycle relatively easily: 

>[!success] Sign of an $n$-Cycle
>An $n$-cycle is an odd permutation if and only if $n$ is even. 

**Proof**: The proof only requires the following observation: 
$$
(a_1a_2...a_n) = (a_1a_2)(a_1a_3)...(a_1a_n)
$$
so every $n$-cycle can be decomposed into a product of $n-1$ cycles. Hence, $n$ is even if and only if $n-1$ is odd if and only if $(a_1a_2...a_n)$ is an odd permutation. 

Using the result that every permutation can be expressed as disjoint cycles, we have the following nice criteria to determine the sign of any permutation:

>[!success] Sign of any Permutation
>A permutation $\sigma$ is odd if and only if the number of cycles of even lengths in its cycle decomposition is odd. 

As an example, we have: 

>[!example] Determining the Sign of a Permutation
>Let $\sigma = (123)(1245)(23)(2456)$, then using the above proposition, we can easily deduce that $\epsilon(\sigma) = -1$ as it contains three cycles of even lengths. 

### The Alternating Groups $A_n$

The Alternating group is defined to be the subgroup of $S_n$ consisting of all **even permutations**: 

>[!d] Alternating Group $A_n$
>The *Alternating Group* $A_n$ consists of all the even permutations in $S_n$, i.e.
>$$
>A_n = \{ \sigma \in S_n : \epsilon(\sigma) = 1 \}
>$$

It is easy to verify that $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$: 

>[!success] $A_n$ is a Group
>$A_n \leq S_n$. 

**Proof**: Trivial using the fact that the sign of permutations in $S_n$ is a homomorphism. 

As $\epsilon(\sigma)$ is a surjective homomorphism from $S_n$ to $\{\pm1\}$ and $A_n = \text{Ker}(\epsilon)$ (All even permutations have sign $1$), we can easily derive, using the [[Isomorphism Theorems#First Isomorphism Theorem|First Isomorphism Theorem]] the following proposition: 

>[!success] Isomorphism Type of $S_n / A_n$
>$S_n / A_n \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2$. 

This further implies that $[S_n : A_n] = 2$, where the square brackets denote the [[Lagrange's Theorem and Products of Groups|index]] of $A_n$ in $S_n$. From [[Lagrange's Theorem and Products of Groups#Normal Subgroups Applying Lagrange]], we have that any finite subgroup of index $2$ is [[Quotient Groups#Normal Subgroups and Quotient Groups|normal]], hence, the following corollary can be derived easily: 

>[!important] Corollary
>$A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$.
