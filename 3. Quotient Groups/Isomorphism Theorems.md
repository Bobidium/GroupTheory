### First Isomorphism Theorem

On the basis of our previous discussions about fibers and kernels in [[Quotient Groups]], we have the following natural but highly useful result: 

>[!success] First Isomorphism Theorem
>Let $\varphi:  G \to H$ be a group homomorphism, then: 
>$$
>G / \text{Ker}(\varphi) \simeq \text{Im}(\varphi)
>$$

**Proof**: Define the function $f: G / \text{Ker}(\varphi) \to \text{Im}(\varphi)$ by $f(gK) = \varphi(g)$ for any $h \in \text{Im}(\varphi)$ and $K = \text{Ker}(\varphi)$. This map is well defined as suppose $gK = g'K$, we have $g^{-1}g' \in K$, so naturally $\varphi(g^{-1}g') = e \iff \varphi(g)  = \varphi(g')$, and conseuqently:
$$
f(gK) = \varphi(g) = \varphi(g') = f(g'K)
$$
$f$ is clearly surjective and to prove injectivity, simply notice that $\varphi(g) = \varphi(g')$ if and only if $g^{-1}g' \in K$ if and only if $gK = g'K$. Finally, $f$ is a homomorphism since:
$$
f(gKg'K) = f(gg'K) = gg' = f(gK)f(g'K)
$$
which completes the proof for the First Isomorphism Theorem. 

Notice that since the Kernel is a normal subgroup, the quotient group on the LHS is defined.
