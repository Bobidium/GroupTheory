### Lagrangeâ€˜s Theorem

Lagrange's Theorem is one of the most elegant and important theorems in the theory of finite groups. It makes a direct linkage between the order of a group and all of its subgroups: 

>[!success] Lagrange's Theorem
>Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H \leq G$, then:
>$$
>|H| \mid |G|
>$$
>i.e. the order of any subgroup of $G$ divides the order of $G$. 

**Proof**: We proceed by using [[Quotient Groups#Cosets|Cosets]]. Denote the set of all left cosets of $H$ by $G / H$. We first show that all left cosets of $H$ have the same cardinality, i.e. $|H|$. For any two costs $gH, g'H \in G/H$, we define the map $f: gH \to g'H$ by $f(gh) = g'h$ for all $h \in H$, then clearly this is surjective and injectivity is guaranteed by right cancellation: $gh = g'h \implies h = h'$. Hence, $f$ is a bijection between any two left cosets of $H$, and consequently, all left cosets have the same Cardinality. From the note of [[Quotient Groups]], we have the result that all left cosets of $H$ partition $G$, so naturally:
$$
|G| = |H| |G/H| \implies  | H| \mid |G|
$$
where $|H|$ is the cardinality of each coset and $|G/H|$ is the total number of distinct cosets. This completes the poof of Lagrange's Theorem. 

In general, the number of distinct left (right) cosets is given a name: 

>[!d] Index of a Subgroup
>Let $G$ be a group and $H \leq G$, then the *index* of $H$ in $G$ is the number of distinct left (right) cosets of $H$ in $G$. This is denoted as $[G:H]$. 

>[!warning] Note
>* When $G$ is infinite, a subgroup of $G$ may still have a finite index. Examples of this include the set of all multiples of $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, denoted by $n\mathbb{Z}$: this subgroup has index $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. 
>* It is also worth noting that when $G$ is infinite, the $[G: H]$ is not necessarily $|G| / |H|$ as **Lagrange's Theorem only applies to finite groups**.

With Lagrange's Theorem, we have the following easy corollaries: 

>[!success] The Index of Subgroups in Finite Groups
>Let $G$ be a finite group and $H\leq G$, then 
>$$
>[G: H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}
>$$

**Proof**: Trivial. 

>[!success] Order of Elements Divide Order of Group
>Let $G$ be a finite group. For any $x \in G$, $o(x) \mid |G|$. Consequently:
>$$
>x^{|G|} = e
>$$

**Proof**: Consider the subgroup generated by $x$. From the [[Cyclic Groups]], we know that $o(x) = |\langle x \rangle|$, and by Lagrange's Theorem, $|\langle x \rangle| \mid |G|$$, so consequently, $o(x) \mid |G|$. The second part of the proposition is then trivial. 

We can use this proposition to prove the following interesting result: 

>[!example] Subgroups of Finite Index in $\mathbb{Q}$
>$(\mathbb{Q}, +)$ contain no proper subgroups of finite order. 

**Proof**: Firstly, notice that $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$ is Abelian, so every subgroup is normal, which allows us to consider quotient groups. Suppose FTSOC that $H \leq \mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subgroup and $[\mathbb{Q}:H] = n$, then the quotient group $\mathbb{Q} / H$ is a finite group. Applying the above proposition shows that for any $qH \in \mathbb{Q} / H$, 
$$
(qH)^n = nqH = H
$$
As the cosets $qH$ partition $\mathbb{Q}$, this further implies tha for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$, $nx \in H$. However, notice that $n\mathbb{Q} = \{nq : n \in \mathbb{Z}, \; q \in \mathbb{Q}\} = \mathbb{Q}$, which is a contradiction. Hence, there exists no proper subgroups of finite index in $\mathbb{Q}$.
